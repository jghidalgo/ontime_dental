# Contacts Module Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented full-stack integration for the Contacts module, connecting the UI with MongoDB backend through GraphQL.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Setup ✅
- **MongoDB**: Started MongoDB container on Docker (port 27017)
- **Collections Created**:
  - `directory_entities` - Stores company/entity information
  - `directory_entries` - Stores contact directory entries (extensions, departments, employees)
  - `clinic_locations` - Stores clinic location data with coordinates and details

### 2. Mongoose Models ✅
Created three professional models with proper TypeScript interfaces:

- **`DirectoryEntity.ts`**: Entity metadata (Bluno James Dental Group, OnTime Dental Holdings)
- **`DirectoryEntry.ts`**: Contact entries with groups (corporate, frontdesk, offices)
- **`ClinicLocation.ts`**: Clinic locations with embedded clinics array and map coordinates

### 3. GraphQL Schema ✅
Extended `typeDefs.ts` with:
- **Types**: DirectoryEntity, DirectoryEntry, DirectoryEntityWithEntries, Clinic, ClinicLocation, Coordinates
- **Queries**: 
  - `allDirectoryData` - Get all entities with their grouped entries
  - `directoryEntityWithEntries` - Get single entity with entries
  - `clinicLocations` - Get all clinic locations
  - `clinicLocation` - Get single clinic location by companyId
- **Mutations**: CRUD operations for directory entries and clinic locations

### 4. GraphQL Resolvers ✅
Implemented in `resolvers.ts`:
- Complete query resolvers with efficient data fetching
- Mutation resolvers for creating, updating, and deleting entries
- Proper error handling and data transformation

### 5. Apollo Client Integration ✅
- Updated `providers.tsx` to include ApolloProvider
- Configured HTTP link with authentication
- Set up token-based authentication from localStorage

### 6. GraphQL Queries ✅
Created `queries.ts` with:
- `GET_ALL_DIRECTORY_DATA` - Fetch all directory entities with entries
- `GET_CLINIC_LOCATIONS` - Fetch all clinic locations
- Proper query structure with all required fields

### 7. Database Seeding ✅
Created `seed-contacts.ts`:
- Migrated all hardcoded data from UI to MongoDB
- 2 directory entities
- 11 directory entries (across corporate, frontdesk, offices)
- 2 clinic location companies with 6 total clinics
- Added npm script: `npm run seed:contacts`

### 8. UI Integration - Contacts Page ✅
**Updated `src/app/contacts/page.tsx`**:
- Removed hardcoded `directory` array
- Integrated `useQuery` with `GET_ALL_DIRECTORY_DATA`
- Added loading and error states
- Updated data structure to match GraphQL response
- Fixed all TypeScript issues
- Changed from `entity.id` to `entity.entityId` for proper mapping
- Added proper accessibility (htmlFor on labels)

### 9. UI Integration - Locations Search Page ✅
**Updated `src/app/contacts/locations-search/page.tsx`**:
- Removed hardcoded `companyLocations` array
- Integrated `useQuery` with `GET_CLINIC_LOCATIONS`
- Added loading and error states
- Updated all clinic references from `clinic.id` to `clinic.clinicId`
- Fixed iframe title for accessibility
- Improved token decoding function
- Added proper labels with htmlFor attributes

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
UI Component → Apollo Client → GraphQL API (/api/graphql) 
→ Resolvers → Mongoose Models → MongoDB → Response back to UI
```

### Authentication
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage (`ontime.authToken`)
- Token included in GraphQL requests via Apollo Link
- Automatic redirection to `/login` if no token

### Performance Optimizations
- `useMemo` for computed data to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient MongoDB queries with proper indexing
- Compound index on `entityId` and `group` for fast lookups

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `src/models/DirectoryEntity.ts`
2. `src/models/DirectoryEntry.ts`
3. `src/models/ClinicLocation.ts`
4. `src/graphql/queries.ts`
5. `scripts/seed-contacts.ts`

### Modified:
1. `src/graphql/typeDefs.ts` - Extended schema
2. `src/graphql/resolvers.ts` - Added resolvers
3. `src/app/providers.tsx` - Added Apollo Client
4. `src/app/contacts/page.tsx` - Connected to GraphQL
5. `src/app/contacts/locations-search/page.tsx` - Connected to GraphQL
6. `package.json` - Added seed:contacts script

## How to Use

### Seed the Database
```bash
npm run seed:contacts
```

### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Access the Application
- Login: http://localhost:3001/login
- Contacts: http://localhost:3001/contacts
- Locations Search: http://localhost:3001/contacts/locations-search

## Testing Checklist

✅ MongoDB connection successful
✅ Data seeded correctly (2 entities, 11 entries, 6 clinics)
✅ GraphQL queries working
✅ UI displays data from backend
✅ Loading states showing during data fetch
✅ Error handling in place
✅ Navigation between pages works
✅ Filter functionality operational
✅ Map integration with Google Maps
✅ Responsive design maintained
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ No lint errors

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Add Create/Edit Forms**: Allow users to add/edit directory entries
2. **Search Functionality**: Add full-text search across contacts
3. **Export Feature**: Implement CSV/PDF export for directory
4. **Real-time Updates**: Add subscriptions for live data updates
5. **Permission Management**: Role-based access control for editing
6. **Audit Trail**: Track changes to directory entries
7. **Import Functionality**: Bulk import from CSV
8. **Advanced Filters**: Filter by department, location, etc.

## Database Schema Summary

### DirectoryEntity
- entityId (String, unique, indexed)
- name (String)
- timestamps

### DirectoryEntry
- entityId (String, indexed)
- group (String, enum: corporate/frontdesk/offices, indexed)
- location (String)
- phone (String)
- extension (String)
